GSR Usage
---------

GSR Component:
   The Global Set Reset (GSR) resource has been used to implement a global reset
        of the design. The reset signal used for GSR control is
        'fpga_gpio_rst_c'.
        

     GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.
        

     Components with disabled GSR Property
-------------------------------------

     These components have the GSR property set to DISABLED. The components will
     not respond to the reset signal 'fpga_gpio_rst_c' via the GSR component.

     Type and number of components of the type: 
   Register = 7 

     Type and instance name of component: 
   Register : print_flag/current_char_i0
   Register : print_flag/current_char_i1
   Register : print_flag/current_char_i2
   Register : print_flag/current_char_i3
   Register : print_flag/current_char_i4
   Register : print_flag/current_char_i5
   Register : print_flag/current_char_i6

     Components with synchronous local reset also reset by asynchronous GSR
----------------------------------------------------------------------

     These components have the GSR property set to ENABLED and the local reset
     is synchronous. The components will respond to the synchronous local reset
     and to the unrelated asynchronous reset signal 'fpga_gpio_rst_c' via the
