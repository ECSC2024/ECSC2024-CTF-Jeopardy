  "description": "ACME Company has been alerted that a threat actor is selling the credentials of one of its users (pwned_user@acme.org) on a dark web forum. To identify the affected service and prevent further compromise, they need to determine which credential was leaked and how it was exfiltrated.  \n\nUnfortunately, the user\u2019s workstation has been formatted, leaving only Sysmon logs collected by the SIEM for analysis. Can you help identify the stolen credential?",
